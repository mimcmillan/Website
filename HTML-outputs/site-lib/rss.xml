Every complex number can be written in this ‘rectangular’ form: Complex sums and products Treat ‘’ like an indefinite variable symbol ‘’.

Any has its complex conjugate that is .For example, the conjugate of is . The conjugate of is . Notice that .
The main useful feature of conjugates is their power to annihilate imaginary parts:

Next we consider ‘polar’ form. The reason to do so is that multiplication is much easier to understand in polar form.The polar form of is written like this: where is a polar coordinate pair indicating the point given in Cartesian coordinates by . The acronym ‘’ stands for .
For example:
which we may also write: Euler Formula The Euler Formula links complex polar to exponentiation: For complex numbers not on the unit circle, incorporate a radius: The main application of this formula is to use exponent rules to help interpret complex multiplication.Complex products, quotients, powers using Euler’s Formula Consider the complex numbers and . Their product is: Their quotient is: The power is: Notice: Simplify: Thus: . Compute . First convert to exponential: Next compute the power: Complex multiplication rule
In general, we have the rule: Complex multiplication: multiply radii and add angles.
In light of that rule, can you understand this statement? Multiplication by means: rotate counterclockwise by .
Also, notice the fact that . So ‘acts upon’ other numbers by rotating them by counterclockwise.The multiplication rule leads to a powers rule in polar notation: De Moivre’s Theorem
In general, we have the rule: Written in polar notation, this means: or, expanded out: The exponential notation leads to a formula for a complex root of any complex number: However, every complex number has distinct complex roots!

An event is a description of something that can take place.
An outcome is a complete description of something that can take place.
All outcomes are events. Typically an event is only a partial description. An outcome is an event of the finest grain.
After an event takes place, the fact that it took place constitutes information.
Information is given and received by communicating the fact that an event took place. The set of outcomes, also called the sample space, is a set of complete descriptions of all things that can take place.
An event is a subset of the set of outcomes.
Infinities
Difficulties with infinity and the continuum mean that sometimes a wild subset is not a valid event.
Notation Write for a typical set of outcomes, for a single outcome. Write or for typical events. Write for the collection of all events. An outcome is considered an event by considering instead the singleton subset that contains just that one outcome.Outcomes and events Flip a fair coin two times. A sample space for this experiment is the set . An outcome such as or means that the first flip is heads and the second is heads (as in ) or tails (in ). Note that a single outcome includes the result of both flips. There are more complex events, such as . In words, is the event that the first is heads, the second is heads or tails. (Technically: first heads second heads OR first heads second tails.) Monty Hall
In our version of the Monty Hall game, an outcome is a complete description of a run of the experiment. For example: “Martin first chose Card-3 = Goat-2, then the host revealed Card-2 = Goat-1 and offered a second choice, then Martin switched and received Card-1 = Car.” On the other hand, “Martin was offered a second choice” defines a (complex) event. Technically this event is the subset of all complete outcomes in which Martin was offered a second choice.
Given two events and , we can form new events: is the description: “event or event ”. is the description: “event and event ”. is the description: “not event ”.
Events are mutually exclusive when they do not have any outcomes in common.
Events are exhaustive when they cover all outcomes between them.
Logic operations Set operations
In the mathematical formalism, events are sets, and the logical operations “or”, “and”, “complement” become: the set union. the intersection, also written . the set complement.
The union, intersection, or complement of any pair of events is another valid event.
We can think of these set operations as giving event operations that produce new events from given ones.Infinities
If there are infinitely many events: every countable union or intersection of events is a valid event. Technical , empty set, is called the null event. , subset of, says that every outcome in is also in . Events are mutually exclusive when . Events are exhaustive when .
(These properties can be applied to more than two events.) We write for the number of elements of (or when it’s not finite). Relations
Set union, intersection, and complement satisfy rules. Two of the rules are followed also by addition and multiplication, so they are said to give an algebra structure to events: Associativity: .
Distributivity: .
Events also satisfy:
De Morgan’s Laws This means: you can distribute “ ” but must simultaneously do a switch .Composite experiments and conditional probability trees
A pharmaceutical experiment involves trialing Drug and Drug and Placebo on male and female lab rats. A rat is chosen at random from a collection housing males and females. This is the first part of a composite experiment. Then a drug is chosen and administered. This is the second part. The composite experiment can be described by a tree:
<img alt="Pasted image 20230826115340.png" src="packets/attachments/pasted-image-20230826115340.png" target="_self" style="width: 300px; max-width: 100%;">
There are paths through the tree, and each path is an outcome of the experiment.
One could add a third component, the result in the rat (Good or Bad). The new tree would describe 12 outcomes.
Roll a die then flip a coin
Riley rolls a fair die twice, and then flips a coin. Describe the sample space of this experiment. How many outcomes does it contain?
Role a die then flip some coins
Savannah rolls a die. If the outcome is even, she flips a coin. If the outcome is odd, she flips two coins, and records heads if there are two heads, otherwise she records tails. Describe the sample space of this experiment. How many outcomes does it contain?
Counting outcomes: permutations and combinations
In a lottery, five distinct numbers are picked at random from . How many possible outcomes are there: (a) If we care about the order of numbers.
(b) If the order does not matter. Cardinality of an event
Each of 3 people flips a coin and rolls a die. The sample space can be modeled by . There are total outcomes in this space.
Let event be given by “the number of heads and sum of die rolls is even”. What is ? This event is the intersection of “even number of heads” and “even sum of dice”. The former has 4 elements.
For the latter, here is the distribution of number of ways to get a given sum: So there are ways for an even sum, and we have .
Each event is associated with a probability of its occurrence, which is a quantity representing its degree of likelihood.The meaning of this quantity is the subject of controversy.
Classical theorists hold that probability derives from the symmetry of a situation (dice, coins, poker)
Evidentialists hold that probability relates known evidence to a proposed hypothesis
Bayesians hold that probability measures the degrees of belief of persons
Frequentists hold that probability derives from the pattern in repeated trials
Propensity theorists hold that probability measures a causal power or tendency inhering in objects
A probability measure is a function , is the collection of events (including outcomes as singletons ) is the real numbers,
such that satisfies the rules: for each , “non-negativity”
, “normalization” when , “additivity”
where the last rule applies to countable collections too: These rules are called the Kolmogorov Axioms.The collected data of a sample space , a set of subset events , and a probability measure , taken together as an ordered triple , is called a probability space.Consequences
Decomposition: find exclusive and compute instead of .
Negation: compute instead of .
Monotonicity: if then .
Inclusion-exclusion: even if are not exclusive, you can take instead of .
Inclusion-exclusion
This is a useful counting principle, and it applies to probabilities because of additivity:
An extended version works for three events:
Further extended versions work for more events.Probability Venn diagram
At the university, 25% of students wear a watch, 30% wear a bracelet, and 60% wear neither. What is the probability that a randomly chosen student is wearing either a watch or a bracelet? What is the probability this student is wearing both?
Probability intersection theory
Suppose and . Show that .
In the following examples, the sample space is finite, and a probability measure is determined by counting the number of outcomes in a given event and dividing by the total number of outcomes in the sample space. This is equivalent to assuming that each outcome is equally likely.Counting outcomes
Problem: A fair coin is flipped four times. What is the probability that the first and third flips are heads?
Solution: There are total outcomes. The outcomes may be written as -tuples with either or . Write for the event containing the -tuples with and anything else. Then by counting, . So .
Exclusive OR
Problem: The professor chooses three students at random, one to be Host, one to be Player, one to be Judge. What is the probability that Lucia is either Host or Player?
Solution: The number of ways Lucia ends up Host is and the number of ways she ends up Player is also . The total number of outcomes is . Lucia cannot be Host and Player, so they are exclusive events, and we use Decomposition. We have: Counting teams with Cooper
Problem: A team of 3 student volunteers is formed at random from a class of 40. What is the probability that Cooper is on the team?
Solution: There are teams that include Cooper, and teams in total. We have: Haley and Hugo from two random selections
Problem: The class has 40 students. Suppose the professor chooses 3 students today at random, and again 3 on Thursday. What is the probability that Haley is chosen today and Hugo on Thursday?
Solution: The outcomes can be described by ordered pairs of sets each containing three elements, where contains three students chosen today, and contains three chosen on Thursday. There are possible sets for and the same number for . So there are valid outcomes.
There are sets that contain Haley, and the same number that contain Hugo. (This number is equal to the number of sets of two students taken from the 39 students that are not Haley.) So there are pairs of sets with Haley in the first set, Hugo in the second set.
Let be the event of interest, that Haley is included today AND Hugo is included on Thursday. The final probability is the ratio of the number of outcomes in to the total number of outcomes: Wisconsin flag
A kindergarten class hangs a random state flag (50 flags) on the wall every day. What is the probability that two days out of three given days have Wisconsin’s flag?
Drawing balls of distinct color
An urn contains 3 green and 4 yellow balls. Two balls are drawn out. What is the probability that they are different colors?
If the sample space is infinite, then we cannot generate a probability measure by counting and dividing. Usually the context suggests another natural measure.Rolling die until 4
Suppose we roll a fair die repeatedly until the number 4 comes up. An outcome is a play of this game, and is recorded by the number of rolls required. The natural probability measure comes from the assumption that in a single roll, each number is equally likely. Let be the probability of the game requiring rolls. Then: because this game is the same as the game in which we roll 3 times and ask for the odds that only the last roll is a 4.
4 will come up ‘eventually’
Roll a fair die repeatedly until the number 4 comes up, and let denote the outcome where rolls are required. What is ?

Break a stick at a random location. What is the probability that the short piece is less than the original length?

An urn contains four balls: 1 white, 1 green, 2 red. We draw 3 balls with replacement. Find the probability that we did not see all three colors. Use two different methods, as specified by (a) and (b) below. (a) Define the event and similarly for and . Use inclusion-exclusion.
(b) Compute the probability by considering the complement of the event that we did not see all three colors. Paying bill with cash, check, card
A restaurant offers three ways of paying the bill: cash, check, and card. At the end of the day there were 100 paid bills. Some of the bills were paid with a mix of cash, check, and card. There are 78 cash receipts, 26 card receipts, and 16 checks. There were 13 bills that used cash and card, 4 that used card and check, 6 that used cash and check, and 3 that used all three methods of payment. (a) If a bill is chosen at random, what is the probability that the bill was paid fully using only one of the methods?
(b) If two distinct bills are chosen at random, what is the probability that at least one was paid using two or more methods? First Ace, second spade
Two cards are drawn without replacement from a standard 52-card deck. What is the probability that the first is an Ace, and the second is a spade?
We define the “conditional probability of , given ,” written , by the simple formula: The idea of this definition is to create a new probability space out of the event itself, such that the relative probabilities of events within agree with their relative probabilities as events in . The divisor is said to ‘renormalize’ the probability measure so that the total probability of is now .The new probability measure ‘conditioned on ’ is then (here any event may be plugged into the slot).Conditional probability is ordinary probability
Show that a conditional probability measure satisfies the Kolmogorov Axioms.
Simplify expressions
Let . Simplify the following probabilities: , , , .
If the probability measure comes from counting outcomes or from taking length or area, conditioning by means that we take the successful outcomes that lie within and divide by the valid outcomes in .<img alt="Pasted image 20230901170427.png" src="packets/attachments/pasted-image-20230901170427.png" target="_self" style="width: 200px; max-width: 100%;">
Conditioning is a type of restriction process, as that notion arises in mathematics more generally. The conditioned probability measure is the old measure restricted to and renormalized.Red marbles in the vase
Problem: An urn contains 4 red marbles and 6 clear marbles. We draw 3 marbles from the urn and put them in a frosted white vase. We see some red color through the glass, but can’t tell how many marbles are red. What is the probability that exactly 2 are red?
Solution: Let be the event that there is some red, and the event that exactly two are red. So we seek . In fact because . Now where means no red, and we easily compute: On the other hand: Multiplication rule
For events , , we have: For events we have: Dealing cards: queen, king, ace
Three cards are dealt from a deck, in a line. What is the probability that they are, in order, a queen, a king, and an ace?
Bayes’ Theorem is sometimes called Bayes’ Rule or Bayes’ Law, perhaps because it is mathematically trivial. It says: The derivation is simple: We use alphabetical order , as a mnemonic for the fact that comes first in time, or otherwise that is the easier conditional from which to calculate the other.In practice, the main application of Bayes’ Theorem is to compute when it is easy to compute from other principles. Often this occurs in multi-stage experiments where event describes outcomes of an intermediate stage.Division into cases
The following fact is sometimes useful: This rule tells us that to compute we can divide into cases using any event (such as a precursor) and its complement event .Law of total probability
The identity for division into cases can be generalized to the situation where are mutually exclusive and exhaustive events. In that case we have: Law of total probability proof
Prove the law of total probability. Use it to prove the identity for division into cases.
Total probability and COVID
Problem: Assume that 0.5% of people have COVID right now. Suppose a COVID test gives a (true) positive on 96% of patients who have COVID, but gives a (false) positive on 2% of patients who do not have COVID. A random person tests positive. What is the probability that they have COVID?
Solution: Let be the event that a person has COVID, and let be the event that they test positive. We are given and and . Then compute using Bayes’ Theorem and dividing into cases: Intuitions
Some people find the low number surprising. In order to fix your intuitions, think about it this way: roughly 2.5% of tests are positive, with about 2% coming from false positives, and about 0.5% from true positives. The true ones make up only of the positive results.
If two tests both come back positive, the odds of COVID are now 98%. If only sick people are tested, so that 20% of those tested have COVID, , then one positive test gives a COVID probability of 92%.
Inferring the die from the roll
A bag contains one 4-sided die, one 6-sided die, and one 12-sided die. You draw a random die from the bag and roll it and get a 4. What is the probability that you rolled a 6-sided die?
Inferring the urn from the marble
Problem: A fair coin is tossed. If the outcome is heads, Urn H is selected, otherwise Urn T is selected. Urn H has 2 green balls and 3 red balls. Urn T has 2 green balls and 6 yellow balls. A ball is drawn at random. (a) What is the probability that we draw a green ball?
(b) Suppose a green ball is drawn. What is the probability it was drawn from Urn H? Solution: We can use conditional probability for both questions. Let events , name the urns chosen, and event indicate that a green ball was chosen.
(a) We use the rule . Clearly this is .
(b) Since an urn is chosen before the ball is drawn, this is an inverse probability question, and we try to use Bayes’ Theorem to calculate. We know , and we seek . We have , and we also need . Then find: Traditional Monty Hall problem.
Assume Guest switches doors 50% of the time, and keeps the first door the other 50% of the time. Let be the event that Guest first chooses the car, and let be the event that Guest ends up with the car. Let us find , the probability that Guest first chose the car given that they ended up with the car.
It is easier to calculate , the probability Guest ends up with the car, given that they chose it first: . We also know and: From this we plug into Bayes’ Theorem and find that: The fact that tells us that knowing , i.e. the fact that Guest ended up winning, does not change our knowledge of the likelihood of , the fact that Guest picked the car the first time.
Now suppose we know 75% of people switch their choices. This means . We still have . But this time we find: So Therefore , and the knowledge that happened changes our expectations regarding , making it less likely. In terms of the game, it means: if most people take the (better!) strategy of “switching”, then knowledge that Guest won the game makes it less likely that Guest originally picked the car. (Guests who switch always lose when they originally pick the car.)
Flipping a coin times
Problem: An integer is chosen at random from . Then a fair coin is flipped times. (a) What is the probability that exactly flips came up heads?
(b) Suppose this experiment is run and it is known that flips came up heads. What is the probability that the chosen was ? Solution: Let be the event that was the chosen integer. Let be the event that of the coin flips came up heads. (Here provided .) The sample space may be described by , where a pair represents the outcome and .
The probability measure is determined by: These numbers determine probabilities for all other events by additivity.
(a) This is the event and its probability is given by the sum , which can be written out: (b) We are asked for the conditional probability . We can compute this using Bayes’ Theorem: Actually we can also compute this directly from the definition , and we find the same number.
Roll distinct numbers, was there a 6?
You roll two fair dice, and tell me that the two numbers are distinct. What do I estimate for the probability that there is at least one 6?
Boy Girl Paradox
You are going to meet the king. Along the way, you are told that he has one sibling. What do you estimate is the probability that his sibling is a sister?
The formula was taken as a mathematical definition.In reality, one can give preliminary conceptual definitions to each of these terms: is the probability that event takes place, given the knowledge that has taken place already is the probability that event “ and ” takes place is the probability that event takes place
With these as philosophical definitions, one must find additional justification for the identity . This identity, once made, immediately gives Bayes’ Theorem.Justifying Bayes’ Theorem
One type of justification is that if a gambler updates his or her degrees of belief using Bayes’ Theorem and the axioms of probability, he or she will avoid a “Dutch Book”, i.e. a collection of bets that leads to sure losses. However, it is not necessary to follow Bayesian updating to avoid Dutch Books consistently.
Bayes’ Theorem can be written in a slightly different form: Here we interpret: is the prior probability of some hypothesis is the probability of some evidence is the posterior probability of given the evidence This version of Bayes’ Theorem can be interpreted as an update rule, i.e. a rule for updating probability estimates. If you have some hypothesis , and you gain new, relevant, evidence , you may wish to know how to adjust your estimate of the likelihood of . This rule says to multiply the prior by the ratio . The numerator: how likely is evidence given the hypothesis? The denominator: how likely is evidence , period? If the ratio is high, the hypothesis strongly boosts the likelihood of ; Bayes’ Rule then says the appearance of boosts likelihood of by this same ratio.“The factor by which makes more likely equals the factor by which makes more likely.”Bayes’ Rule and symmetries
The Bayes’ Rule exhibits a symmetry: and are treated on the same footing mathematically. In the real world, is typically data, while is typically a theory or explanation. Or again: in the real world is usually made first, and comes after. The latter ordering is reflected also in the multi-stage experiments where comes first, and second, and Bayes’ Rule is typically used to assess based on and simple calculations of .
This is weird! Why does a “theorem” with perfect symmetry arise only for applications with notable lack of symmetry?
Is Jack left handed?
At some point during a criminal investigation, Detective Inspector Morse is 60% convinced that Jack is guilty. Morse then finds evidence that the suspect must be left handed. It turns out Jack is left handed! (Note that 20% of the population is left handed.) What should Morse’s new confidence level be?
