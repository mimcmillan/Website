Typically an event is only a partial description. An outcome is an event of the finest grain.\nAfter an event takes place, the fact that it took place constitutes information.\nInformation is given and received by communicating the fact that an event took place. The set of outcomes, also called the sample space, is a set of complete descriptions of all things that can take place.\nAn event is a subset of the set of outcomes.\nInfinities\nDifficulties with infinity and the continuum mean that sometimes a wild subset is not a valid event.\nNotation Write for a typical set of outcomes, for a single outcome. Write or for typical events. Write for the collection of all events. An outcome is considered an event by considering instead the singleton subset that contains just that one outcome.Outcomes and events Flip a fair coin two times. A sample space for this experiment is the set . An outcome such as or means that the first flip is heads and the second is heads (as in ) or tails (in ). Note that a single outcome includes the result of both flips. There are more complex events, such as . In words, is the event that the first is heads, the second is heads or tails. (Technically: first heads second heads OR first heads second tails.) Monty Hall\nIn our version of the Monty Hall game, an outcome is a complete description of a run of the experiment. For example: “Martin first chose Card-3 = Goat-2, then the host revealed Card-2 = Goat-1 and offered a second choice, then Martin switched and received Card-1 = Car.” On the other hand, “Martin was offered a second choice” defines a (complex) event. Technically this event is the subset of all complete outcomes in which Martin was offered a second choice.\nGiven two events and , we can form new events: is the description: “event or event ”. is the description: “event and event ”. is the description: “not event ”.\nEvents are mutually exclusive when they do not have any outcomes in common.\nEvents are exhaustive when they cover all outcomes between them.\nLogic operations Set operations\nIn the mathematical formalism, events are sets, and the logical operations “or”, “and”, “complement” become: the set union. the intersection, also written . the set complement.\nThe union, intersection, or complement of any pair of events is another valid event.\nWe can think of these set operations as giving event operations that produce new events from given ones.Infinities\nIf there are infinitely many events: every countable union or intersection of events is a valid event. Technical , empty set, is called the null event. , subset of, says that every outcome in is also in . Events are mutually exclusive when . Events are exhaustive when .\n(These properties can be applied to more than two events.) We write for the number of elements of (or when it’s not finite). Relations\nSet union, intersection, and complement satisfy rules. Two of the rules are followed also by addition and multiplication, so they are said to give an algebra structure to events: Associativity: .\nDistributivity: .\nEvents also satisfy:\nDe Morgan’s Laws This means: you can distribute “ ” but must simultaneously do a switch .Composite experiments and conditional probability trees\nA pharmaceutical experiment involves trialing Drug and Drug and Placebo on male and female lab rats. A rat is chosen at random from a collection housing males and females. This is the first part of a composite experiment. Then a drug is chosen and administered. This is the second part.

How many outcomes does it contain?\nRole a die then flip some coins\nSavannah rolls a die. If the outcome is even, she flips a coin. If the outcome is odd, she flips two coins, and records heads if there are two heads, otherwise she records tails. Describe the sample space of this experiment. How many outcomes does it contain?\nCounting outcomes: permutations and combinations\nIn a lottery, five distinct numbers are picked at random from .

This event is the intersection of “even number of heads” and “even sum of dice”. The former has 4 elements.\nFor the latter, here is the distribution of number of ways to get a given sum: So there are ways for an even sum, and we have .\nEach event is associated with a probability of its occurrence, which is a quantity representing its degree of likelihood.The meaning of this quantity is the subject of controversy.\nClassical theorists hold that probability derives from the symmetry of a situation (dice, coins, poker)\nEvidentialists hold that probability relates known evidence to a proposed hypothesis\nBayesians hold that probability measures the degrees of belief of persons\nFrequentists hold that probability derives from the pattern in repeated trials\nPropensity theorists hold that probability measures a causal power or tendency inhering in objects\nA probability measure is a function , is the collection of events (including outcomes as singletons ) is the real numbers,\nsuch that satisfies the rules: for each , “non-negativity”\n, “normalization” when , “additivity”\nwhere the last rule applies to countable collections too: These rules are called the Kolmogorov Axioms.The collected data of a sample space , a set of subset events , and a probability measure , taken together as an ordered triple , is called a probability space.Consequences\nDecomposition: find exclusive and compute instead of .\nNegation: compute instead of .\nMonotonicity: if then .\nInclusion-exclusion: even if are not exclusive, you can take instead of .\nInclusion-exclusion\nThis is a useful counting principle, and it applies to probabilities because of additivity:\nAn extended version works for three events:\nFurther extended versions work for more events.Probability Venn diagram\nAt the university, 25% of students wear a watch, 30% wear a bracelet, and 60% wear neither.

So there are pairs of sets with Haley in the first set, Hugo in the second set.\nLet be the event of interest, that Haley is included today AND Hugo is included on Thursday. The final probability is the ratio of the number of outcomes in to the total number of outcomes: Wisconsin flag\nA kindergarten class hangs a random state flag (50 flags) on the wall every day. What is the probability that two days out of three given days have Wisconsin’s flag?\nDrawing balls of distinct color\nAn urn contains 3 green and 4 yellow balls. Two balls are drawn out. What is the probability that they are different colors?\nIf the sample space is infinite, then we cannot generate a probability measure by counting and dividing. Usually the context suggests another natural measure.Rolling die until 4\nSuppose we roll a fair die repeatedly until the number 4 comes up. An outcome is a play of this game, and is recorded by the number of rolls required. The natural probability measure comes from the assumption that in a single roll, each number is equally likely. Let be the probability of the game requiring rolls. Then: because this game is the same as the game in which we roll 3 times and ask for the odds that only the last roll is a 4.\n4 will come up ‘eventually’\nRoll a fair die repeatedly until the number 4 comes up, and let denote the outcome where rolls are required.

Paying bill with cash, check, card\nA restaurant offers three ways of paying the bill: cash, check, and card. At the end of the day there were 100 paid bills. Some of the bills were paid with a mix of cash, check, and card. There are 78 cash receipts, 26 card receipts, and 16 checks. There were 13 bills that used cash and card, 4 that used card and check, 6 that used cash and check, and 3 that used all three methods of payment.

First Ace, second spade\nTwo cards are drawn without replacement from a standard 52-card deck. What is the probability that the first is an Ace, and the second is a spade?\nWe define the “conditional probability of , given ,” written , by the simple formula: The idea of this definition is to create a new probability space out of the event itself, such that the relative probabilities of events within agree with their relative probabilities as events in . The divisor is said to ‘renormalize’ the probability measure so that the total probability of is now .The new probability measure ‘conditioned on ’ is then (here any event may be plugged into the slot).Conditional probability is ordinary probability\nShow that a conditional probability measure satisfies the Kolmogorov Axioms.\nSimplify expressions\nLet .

The conditioned probability measure is the old measure restricted to and renormalized.Red marbles in the vase\nProblem: An urn contains 4 red marbles and 6 clear marbles. We draw 3 marbles from the urn and put them in a frosted white vase. We see some red color through the glass, but can’t tell how many marbles are red. What is the probability that exactly 2 are red?\nSolution: Let be the event that there is some red, and the event that exactly two are red. So we seek . In fact because . Now where means no red, and we easily compute: On the other hand: Multiplication rule\nFor events , , we have: For events we have: Dealing cards: queen, king, ace\nThree cards are dealt from a deck, in a line. What is the probability that they are, in order, a queen, a king, and an ace?\nBayes’ Theorem is sometimes called Bayes’ Rule or Bayes’ Law, perhaps because it is mathematically trivial. It says: The derivation is simple: We use alphabetical order , as a mnemonic for the fact that comes first in time, or otherwise that is the easier conditional from which to calculate the other.In practice, the main application of Bayes’ Theorem is to compute when it is easy to compute from other principles. Often this occurs in multi-stage experiments where event describes outcomes of an intermediate stage.Division into cases\nThe following fact is sometimes useful: This rule tells us that to compute we can divide into cases using any event (such as a precursor) and its complement event .Law of total probability\nThe identity for division into cases can be generalized to the situation where are mutually exclusive and exhaustive events. In that case we have: Law of total probability proof\nProve the law of total probability. Use it to prove the identity for division into cases.\nTotal probability and COVID\nProblem: Assume that 0.5% of people have COVID right now. Suppose a COVID test gives a (true) positive on 96% of patients who have COVID, but gives a (false) positive on 2% of patients who do not have COVID. A random person tests positive. What is the probability that they have COVID?\nSolution: Let be the event that a person has COVID, and let be the event that they test positive. We are given and and . Then compute using Bayes’ Theorem and dividing into cases: Intuitions\nSome people find the low number surprising. In order to fix your intuitions, think about it this way: roughly 2.5% of tests are positive, with about 2% coming from false positives, and about 0.5% from true positives. The true ones make up only of the positive results.\nIf two tests both come back positive, the odds of COVID are now 98%. If only sick people are tested, so that 20% of those tested have COVID, , then one positive test gives a COVID probability of 92%.\nInferring the die from the roll\nA bag contains one 4-sided die, one 6-sided die, and one 12-sided die. You draw a random die from the bag and roll it and get a 4. What is the probability that you rolled a 6-sided die?\nInferring the urn from the marble\nProblem: A fair coin is tossed. If the outcome is heads, Urn H is selected, otherwise Urn T is selected. Urn H has 2 green balls and 3 red balls. Urn T has 2 green balls and 6 yellow balls. A ball is drawn at random. (a) What is the probability that we draw a green ball?\n(b) Suppose a green ball is drawn. What is the probability it was drawn from Urn H? Solution: We can use conditional probability for both questions. Let events , name the urns chosen, and event indicate that a green ball was chosen.\n(a) We use the rule . Clearly this is .\n(b) Since an urn is chosen before the ball is drawn, this is an inverse probability question, and we try to use Bayes’ Theorem to calculate. We know , and we seek . We have , and we also need . Then find: Traditional Monty Hall problem.\nAssume Guest switches doors 50% of the time, and keeps the first door the other 50% of the time. Let be the event that Guest first chooses the car, and let be the event that Guest ends up with the car. Let us find , the probability that Guest first chose the car given that they ended up with the car.\nIt is easier to calculate , the probability Guest ends up with the car, given that they chose it first: . We also know and: From this we plug into Bayes’ Theorem and find that: The fact that tells us that knowing , i.e. the fact that Guest ended up winning, does not change our knowledge of the likelihood of , the fact that Guest picked the car the first time.\nNow suppose we know 75% of people switch their choices. This means . We still have . But this time we find: So Therefore , and the knowledge that happened changes our expectations regarding , making it less likely. In terms of the game, it means: if most people take the (better!) strategy of “switching”, then knowledge that Guest won the game makes it less likely that Guest originally picked the car. (Guests who switch always lose when they originally pick the car.)\nFlipping a coin times\nProblem: An integer is chosen at random from . Then a fair coin is flipped times. (a) What is the probability that exactly flips came up heads?\n(b) Suppose this experiment is run and it is known that flips came up heads. What is the probability that the chosen was ? Solution: Let be the event that was the chosen integer. Let be the event that of the coin flips came up heads. (Here provided .) The sample space may be described by , where a pair represents the outcome and .\nThe probability measure is determined by: These numbers determine probabilities for all other events by additivity.\n(a) This is the event and its probability is given by the sum , which can be written out: (b) We are asked for the conditional probability . We can compute this using Bayes’ Theorem: Actually we can also compute this directly from the definition , and we find the same number.\nRoll distinct numbers, was there a 6?\nYou roll two fair dice, and tell me that the two numbers are distinct. What do I estimate for the probability that there is at least one 6?\nBoy Girl Paradox\nYou are going to meet the king. Along the way, you are told that he has one sibling. What do you estimate is the probability that his sibling is a sister?\nThe formula was taken as a mathematical definition.In reality, one can give preliminary conceptual definitions to each of these terms: is the probability that event takes place, given the knowledge that has taken place already is the probability that event “ and ” takes place is the probability that event takes place\nWith these as philosophical definitions, one must find additional justification for the identity . This identity, once made, immediately gives Bayes’ Theorem.Justifying Bayes’ Theorem\nOne type of justification is that if a gambler updates his or her degrees of belief using Bayes’ Theorem and the axioms of probability, he or she will avoid a “Dutch Book”, i.e. a collection of bets that leads to sure losses. However, it is not necessary to follow Bayesian updating to avoid Dutch Books consistently.\nBayes’ Theorem can be written in a slightly different form: Here we interpret: is the prior probability of some hypothesis is the probability of some evidence is the posterior probability of given the evidence This version of Bayes’ Theorem can be interpreted as an update rule, i.e. a rule for updating probability estimates. If you have some hypothesis , and you gain new, relevant, evidence , you may wish to know how to adjust your estimate of the likelihood of . This rule says to multiply the prior by the ratio . The numerator: how likely is evidence given the hypothesis? The denominator: how likely is evidence , period? If the ratio is high, the hypothesis strongly boosts the likelihood of ; Bayes’ Rule then says the appearance of boosts likelihood of by this same ratio.“The factor by which makes more likely equals the factor by which makes more likely.”Bayes’ Rule and symmetries\nThe Bayes’ Rule exhibits a symmetry: and are treated on the same footing mathematically. In the real world, is typically data, while is typically a theory or explanation. Or again: in the real world is usually made first, and comes after. The latter ordering is reflected also in the multi-stage experiments where comes first, and second, and Bayes’ Rule is typically used to assess based on and simple calculations of .\nThis is weird! Why does a “theorem” with perfect symmetry arise only for applications with notable lack of symmetry?\nIs Jack left handed?\nAt some point during a criminal investigation, Detective Inspector Morse is 60% convinced that Jack is guilty. Morse then finds evidence that the suspect must be left handed. It turns out Jack is left handed! (Note that 20% of the population is left handed.) What should Morse’s new confidence level be?\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n## Problems due 09 Sep 2023, 8:00pmInferring the urn from the marble\nUrn I has 6 green and 4 red marbles, while Urn II has 3 green and 4 red marbles.
